  title: Caleta Gaming System API - Operator's Guide
  description: "# Overview \n\nCaleta Gaming System is complete RGS + RNG system that\
    \ has been designed to offer Game Providers and Operators an easy and quick solution\
    \ for any kind of Game Platform: **Slots**, **Bingo**, **Kenos**, **Video Poker**,\
    \ etc.\n\nThis is Guide intends to provide in some easy steps, how to connect\
    \ into our platform.\n\n\n# Request signing\n\n- All **Games API** requests have\
    \ to be signed by Operator.\n- All **Wallet API** requests have to be signed by\
    \ Caleta.\n\nBefore the integration, the **Operator** generates a **private/public\
    \ key pair** and sends the **public** key to Caleta. \n\nThe body of all requests\
    \ will be signed with `RSA-SHA256` using the respective private key and encoded\
    \ to BASE64 (We have a python script example that <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/paulocaleta/signaturetest/src\"\
    >can be found here</a>). The signature will be placed in the `X-Auth-Signature`\
    \ header.\n\n## Example:\n\nRequest body: `{\"user\":\"test\",\"country\":\"BR\"\
    ,\"currency\":\"EUR\",\"operator_id\":1,\"token\":\"d5dcb4f6-db06-4ab1-9c63-d1f7dc12694e\"\
    ,\"game_id\":10,\"lang\":\"en\",\"lobby_url\":\"https://casinosample.com\",\"\
    deposit_url\":\"https://casinosample.com/deposit\"}`\n\nPrivate Key: <a href=\"\
    https://bitbucket.org/paulocaleta/signaturetest/src/master/keys/key\">download\
    \ here</a>\n\nCorrect signature:\n`eLAVF38xYGp4KyHnybr3vEkKY9l7+G3VJusrY5k+FbseYBXZsRcH6EDP9PTUCkAQNftnq61HAo3fyjPKPxJpRQwBJjZpvSHgf5K/VLquf3GU92kXxQwVC1UQzhboKSfk9Ub9tRRt0sQlfRUdYtLSWYDRrWGuDElTOAgE5uhR6Mlkc5UXSKye1JaQHPxrJyVryHCTgFJd+HCy2QYVMQeEl7yF6RYRqmQPGZuawTbvTvz8nRVu5/z5zFFmEHZc2MPQMQAuweP28FjaGnljMWUE89KH5PxiY5CAYZJmez2WXoL9/Voc4c3PJjntAlIOEzLLQ26NNGRKMLwjUsq8ScEEmA==`\n\
    \n\n# Request consistency\n\nNote that the process is different for DEMO and REAL\
    \ gameplay modes. In DEMO mode, user can open the game and play with fun mode\
    \ money.\n\nBelow is an example of interaction flow to open the game in DEMO mode:\n\
    1. Operator makes a Game API call to `/game/url` to obtain game launch URL. For\
    \ DEMO mode, Operator has to pass `\"currency\":\"FUN\"`. Params `token`, `user`\
    \ may be omitted.\n2. When the game URL is returned, the Operator uses it to direct\
    \ the player to the game (for example, launch it in iframe or redirect player\
    \ to the URL).\n3. In DEMO mode, no calls to Operator's API are made because Caleta\
    \ handle the balance itself.\nIf player liked the game and wants to switch to\
    \ REAL mode, Operator should proceed with the next steps.\n\nBelow is an example\
    \ of interaction flow between the customer, Operator and Caleta in REAL mode:\n\
    1. Operator generates and stores a unique game session token.\n2. Operator makes\
    \ a Game API call `/game/url` and passes the generated token along with the other\
    \ request parameters.\n3. When the game URL is returned, the Operator uses it\
    \ to direct the player to the game (for example, launch it in iframe or redirect\
    \ player to the URL).\n4. When the game URL is loaded in the browser Caleta server\
    \ makes a Wallet API call /wallet/balance to the Operator's server.\n5. Operator\
    \ verifies the token against the stored token and returns the user's balance.\
    \ The user can then place a bet.\n6. When the user attempts to place a bet, Wallet\
    \ API is triggers a `wallet/bet` on the Operator's server.\n7. The Operator verifies\
    \ the token, ensures that the user has enough money for this bet, decreases the\
    \ user's balance by the bet amount, and returns the updated user's balance.\n\
    8. If the user wins, the Wallet API triggers a call `wallet/win` on the Operator's\
    \ server. \n9. Operator verifies the token, increases the user's balance by the\
    \ win amount, and returns the updated user's balance.\n10. Behaviour in case of\
    \ user's loss depends on game Operator's needs. Possible options:\n      * Nothing\
    \ is sent\n      * Sent win with amount 0\n      \n# Generic Seamless Wallet\n\
    \  Caleta has developed a generic seamless Wallet API that is available to any\
    \ operator who wants to use it during their integration. As it requires the use\
    \ of X-Auth-Signature it brings greater security in transactions.\n  As a security\
    \ option, Caleta may sends its public key to the Operator and perform send the\
    \ same `X-Auth-Signature`.\n  ## Optional \n  If the operator already has a Wallet\
    \ API, we can make a custom integration based on Operator's API doc.\n  \n# Handling\
    \ errors\nDuring wallet transactions is 'normal' to have issues between both servers,\
    \ which may be caused by connection issues and also some other special conditions,\
    \ like player out of money and sometimes servers outage. Caleta API was designed\
    \ to cover most of these worst scenarious and created the following rules.\n\n\
    ## BET ERROR\nAny bet that fails will be automatically `DISCARDED` or `ROLLED\
    \ BACK` depending on the operator response. \n\n`KNOWN ERRORS` - Errors where\
    \ we CAN BE SURE the bet does completed. In these cases there is no rollback,\
    \ we simply consider the bet `DISCARDED`. [RS_ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN, RS_ERROR_INVALID_GAME,\
    \ RS_ERROR_WRONG_CURRENCY, RS_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY, RS_ERROR_USER_DISABLED,\
    \ RS_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE, RS_ERROR_WRONG_SYNTAX, RS_ERROR_WRONG_TYPES, RS_ERROR_DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION,\
    \ RS_ERROR_BET_LIMIT_EXCEEDED].\n\n`UNKNOWN ERRORS`- Generic errors that can happen\
    \ in any moment of the bet, so we CAN NOT BE SURE the bet has completed on client\
    \ side. In these cases we consider the bet `ROLLED_BACK` [ RS_ERROR_UNKNOWN, RS_ERROR_TIMEOUT\
    \ ]. Sometimes we receive malformed responses that can't be decoded to JSON so\
    \ we do rollback on these cases as well.  \n\n## WIN ERROR\n\nAny failed win will\
    \ be retried as many times necessary until complete, unless the API returns the\
    \ following status [ RS_ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN, RS_ERROR_INVALID_GAME, RS_ERROR_USER_DISABLED,\
    \ RS_ERROR_WRONG_CURRENCY, RS_ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN, RS_ERROR_DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION,\
    \ RS_ERROR_TRANSACTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST, RS_ERROR_TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK ]. \n\
    When any of the above error appears the game will not continue unless the issue\
    \ is solved by the casino and caleta's team, so please have a good read on the\
    \ status usage to send these status when something pretty wrong is happening.\n\
    \n## ROLLBACK ERROR\n\nAny rollback transaction will be retried as many times\
    \ necessary until complete, unless the API returns the following status [ RS_ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN,\
    \ RS_ERROR_INVALID_GAME, RS_ERROR_WRONG_CURRENCY, RS_ERROR_USER_DISABLED, RS_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE,\
    \ RS_ERROR_DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION, RS_ERROR_TRANSACTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST, RS_ERROR_TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK].\n\
    \n# Policy of open rounds, transactions and archiving\n- We will automatically\
    \ finish all the open rounds with more than 48 hours. \n- We will automatically\
    \ resolve the pending transactions with more than 30 days. \n- We will archive\
    \ all transactions with more than 4 months. \n  \n# Glossary\nAt the bottom of\
    \ this page is located glossary of terms and entities which we use in our system\
    \ and documentation. If you have run into an unknown parameter or need more information\
    \ about a parameter, please, refer to the glossary for the description, examples,\
